# ln-qz
Web application to create and store short-links for otherwise lengthy urls

# What I Learned
<ul>
  <li>DNS</li>
  <li>More in-depth Laravel</li>
  <li>Redirects</li>
</ul>

# What I would improve
I would love to add the ability for registered users to create their own custom shortened links.
Eventually, I would like to integrate ln-qz to my other project <a href="https://github.com/tommypk17/zapfile" target="_blank">ZapFile</a> to allow users to upload files and create short links to their files to share.
